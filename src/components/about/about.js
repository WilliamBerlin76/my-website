                Hello! My name is William Berlin, and Iâ€™m a web developer. 
                I enjoy creating pretty user interfaces, writing clean and efficient backend code, 
                and learning about new things.
            </p>
            <p>
                My primary tech stack is focused around React.js for building frontends for web applications, 
                and Node.js for server side code. I also have experience working with PostgreSQL and MongoDB. 
                However, I have dedicated myself to lifelong learning, and am always excited and willing to learn about new technologies. 
                Outside of programming, I also love to play the trombone and spend time outside with my dog!    
            </p>
            <p>
                Have any questions? Want to work with me? Feel free to reach out to me at william.berlin76@gmail.com,
